It`s one of my first React.js projects, which includes drag'n drop programing, such as making components, using styled components api, managing state and integrate CSS,JavaScript and HTML into the lib. It's relieving to learning the framework that makes the operational routine more fluid, the work flow is nice and efficient

It's exciting expand my knowledge, the project helped me to learn good practices and making a semantic code, it's still in development.
